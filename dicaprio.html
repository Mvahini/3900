	<div id="text">Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born on November 11th, 1974 in Los Angeles, California. He was named after Italian polymath Leonardo Davinci. His career choice as a child was to become a marine biologist or an actor. This made him join UCLA and study performing arts. He became an actor, producer and also environmentalist. He was chosen by People Magazine as one of the “50 most beautiful people in the world” in 1998.
He began his career in 1991 by playing small roles in various episodes until he was approached to play a lead role in "Titanic"(1997) by Janmes Cameron who strongly believed in his acting abilities. Titanic became a blockbuster with its huge box office records and made him a super star. This film won 11 Academy Awards but unfortunately he couldn't get the Oscar in the best Actor category. He won his first Oscar in the year 2016 for the movie "The Revenant" after waiting for 19 years.
